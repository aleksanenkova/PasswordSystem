# PasswordSystem
Implemented the password system. In the project files, objects for the example are added. You can put the password system on a project or application.
 # Compiling guide
To compile a project it is enough to clone the repository, then in the terminal to assemble the project:
#### ` clang++ main.cpp`
After that, you automatically create a.out.
Then run a.out:
#### ` ./a.out`

In order for the program to work correctly, write down the path to the folder with the secret files. 
When the program asks "Какой файл вы хотите открыть?" it is necessary that the file is in a secret folder, otherwise the program will not open it.
